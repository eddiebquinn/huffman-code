# Huffman Encoder/Decoder
In computer science and information theory, a Huffman code is a particular type of optimal prefix code that is commonly used for lossless data compression. I originally got the idea to do this from a hackathon I attended where the goal was to code a version of this in 1h. My team failed at the time, however doing this allowed me to learn about binary trees. Coincidently at the time, I had also been learning JavaScript and wanted a project I could do.

This is my version of a Huffman Encoder/Decoder. This is still a working project, and I do plan to improve it as time goes on.

**Current improvements**
- Create a tree object
- Try to cut down on bloated code
Add a dialogue at the end which allows the user to see how much the code was cut down by
- Create a decoder
- Create an option that allows the user to use a file as input, or get a file from the encoding
